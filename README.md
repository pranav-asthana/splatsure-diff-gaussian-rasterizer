# Differential Gaussian Rasterization

Used as the rasterization engine for the paper "SplatSuRe: Selective Super-Resolution for Multi-view Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting". This code has been derived from "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields". If you can make use of it in your own research, please be so kind to cite us and the orignal [3DGS rasterizer repository](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/diff-gaussian-rasterization).
